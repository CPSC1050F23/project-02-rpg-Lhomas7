CODE DESCRIPTION:
This code is effectively a game, it takes user input and navigates through a house that holds
all different rooms, items, and actions those items and the user can perform. The user has
an inventory in which they hold their items as they naviaget the house. At the end of the user's
game, the code will write a log to the gamelog file displaying the number of steps it took the user
to complete the game. It makes use of classes, modules, files, functions, and loops.
